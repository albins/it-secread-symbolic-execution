# String Injections

```html
User <span onMouseOver="popupText('{{bio}}')">
  {{userName}}
</span>
```

---
template: string-injections

(This example is from [Chen et al., 2017](http://doi.org/10.1145/3158091))

template:string-injections
Ok if `bio = "Amelia was born in 1979..."`:
```html
User
<span onMouseOver="popupText('Amelia was born in 1979...')">
Amelia </span> </h1>
```
---

template: string-injections

...but less so for `bio = "); alert('Boo!'); alert("`:

```html
<span onMouseOver="popupText(''); alert('Boo!'); alert('')">
```

which would inject code that would be executed (an XSS attack).

When do we have an injection? Define an *attack pattern* \\(P\\). Then we have:

--

\\[
x_1 = \mathtt{replaceAll}(temp, \mathtt{\\{\\{userName\\}\\}}, user)
\\]
\\[
\land{}\:  x_2 = \mathtt{replaceAll}(x1, \mathtt{\\{\\{bio\\}\\}}, bio)
\\]
\\[
\land\: x_2 \in P
\\]

--

In this case, \\(P\\) could be e.g. a regular expression identifying an
injection.

# Many Interesting Problems are Undecidable

- Symbolic execution in general
- 3 string variables, concatenation (\\(s_1 \cdot c\\)), and equality (\\(s_1 = s_2\\))
- `replaceAll` with variable patterns (\\(\mathtt{replaceAll}(s_1, s_2, s_3)\\)) [1]
- `replaceAll` with constants and string length (\\(\|s_1\|\\)) [1]
- string equations with string to/from integer conversions [2]
